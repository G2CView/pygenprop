CC  Phosphonates are compounds similar to phosphates, but in which a direct
CC  carbon-phosphorous bond replaces a carbon-oxygen-phosphorous linkage.
CC  They chelate metals, adsorb strongly to surfaces, and are produced and
CC  used industrially to prevent formation of scale on surfaces. The C-P
CC  bond is remarkably stable compared to phosphate bonds, and phosphonate
CC  utilization is rather uncommon. While some enzymes with fairly narrow
CC  specificity are known that cleave the most common naturally occurring
CC  phosphonates, this property describes a multisubunit C-P lyase system
CC  with broad specificity. The specificity may differ from one case to
CC  another, and two systems with overlapping but non-identical
CC  specificities may occur in a single genome.

CC  Phosphonates are a varied class of compound with a direct C-P bond that
CC  can be significantly more stable than indirect C-O-P bond of organic
CC  phosphates. Phosphonates may be toxic but also may be utilized as a
CC  sorce of phosphorus, carbon, and energy. Some species appear to have a
CC  (sometimes two) membrane-associated C-P lyase complex, PhnGHIJKLM, for
CC  degradation of many different (but not all) phosphonates, while other
CC  species have single gene-encoded phosphonatases active on specific
CC  compounds. This property represents the presence of transporters for
CC  phosphonates and related C-P bond-containing compounds (e.g.
CC  phosphites); it should be found in association with either the C-P
CC  lysase membrane complex or specific phoshonatases, but not all of the
CC  latter are known.

CC  The MotAB complex functions as the stator producing torque in the

CC  response to the passage of protons across the cytoplasmic membrane.
CC  This complex is also necessarily a force-generating proton transporter.
